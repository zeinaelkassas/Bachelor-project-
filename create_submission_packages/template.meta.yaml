  # System complexity, metadata provided here may be used to evaluate submitted systems from the computational load perspective.
  complexity:

    # Total amount of parameters used in the acoustic model.
    # For neural networks, this information is usually given before training process in the network summary.
    # For other than neural networks, if parameter count information is not directly available, try estimating the count as accurately as possible.
    # In case of ensemble approaches, add up parameters for all subsystems.
    # In case embeddings are used, add up parameter count of the embedding extraction networks and classification network.
    # Use numerical value.
